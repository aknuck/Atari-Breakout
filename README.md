Atari-Breakout
==============

A Python port of the classic Atari game Breakout for the Atari 2600

Written around April 2013

I tried to make the game as similar to the original as I could. I matched color scheme, point values, and triggers for increasing ball speed. High scores are stored locally, might change that later.

Controls
 - Left and right arrow keys to move the paddle
 - Space bar to launch the ball
 - Enter to start the game
